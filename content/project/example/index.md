summary: A comprehensive analysis of the reference errors in SAR ADCs with a practical reference network circuit (RNC) in consideration. A circuit model is developed in order to quantify the error amplitude for the critical DAC settling condition. Based on the proposed model, the settling behavior of the DAC with reference buffer can be precisely characterized, leading to a better understanding about the design tradeoff of the RNC. Finally, the developed model is verified by both circuit level simulations and measurement results.
