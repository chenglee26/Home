abstract: This paper presents a novel 145–185 GHz transceiver (TRX) with 4
  frequency-shift keying (4FSK) modulation. The proposed non-coherent 4FSK
  design removes the need for separate modulator and demodulator blocks reducing
  the power consumption and complexity. The proposed TX generates four different
  RF frequencies based on the two parallel streams of binary input data, and the
  RX employs a slot power divider to divide the 4FSK RF signal into two paths,
  where the 4FSK RF signal is demodulated and data is recovered by enveloped
  detectors and digital buffers. Both the transmitter and receiver are
  fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology with a total core area of 0.6 mm2 . The
  TRX architecture achieves 17 Gb/s over 18 cm link distance while consuming
  only 182 mW power.
