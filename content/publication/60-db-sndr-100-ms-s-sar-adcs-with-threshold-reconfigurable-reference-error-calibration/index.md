abstract: "This paper presents a reference error calibration scheme for
  successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)
  verified with two prototypes. Such a reference error often occurs in
  high-speed SAR ADCs due to the signal dependent fast switching transient, and
  leads to a large differential nonlinearity and missing codes, eventually
  degrading conversion accuracy. The calibration concept aims to differentiate
  the error outputs and correct them by simply performing a subtraction in the
  digital domain. It runs in the background with a little hardware overhead, and
  does not depend on the type of the input signal or reduce the dynamic range.
  Two prototypes were measured which are made up of different reference
  generation circuits. Design #1 has the reference voltage from off-chip and a
  3-pF decoupling capacitor on-chip, while design #2 includes an on-chip
  reference buffer. Both designs were fabricated in 65-nm CMOS and achieve at
  least 9-dB improvement on signal-to-(Noise + Distortion) ratio (SNDR) after
  calibration. The total core area is around 0.012 mm 2 for both chips and the
  Nyquist SNDR of designs #1 and #2 is 59.03 and 57.93 dB, respectively."
