abstract: The high-speed successive-approximation-register (SAR)
  analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) rely on the switched capacitive
  digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) to perform the fast transition, which
  causes voltage ripples at the output of the reference circuits. Such ripples
  lead to the reference error that eventually prolongs the time for DAC
  settling. To minimize such error with a short available time, it either
  demands a power-hungry reference buffer or large die area for the decoupling.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis of the reference errors in
  SAR ADCs with a practical reference network circuit (RNC) in consideration. A
  circuit model is developed in order to quantify the error amplitude for the
  critical DAC settling condition. Based on the proposed model, the settling
  behavior of the DAC with reference buffer can be precisely characterized,
  leading to a better understanding about the design tradeoff of the RNC.
  Finally, the developed model is verified by both circuit level simulations and
  measurement results.
