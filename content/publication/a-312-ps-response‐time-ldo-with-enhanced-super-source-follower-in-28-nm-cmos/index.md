abstract: High quality fully integrated power supplies could notably improve the
  performances of the noise‐sensitive building block in the UWB communication
  systems. Double buffers are inserted into the cascode flipped‐voltage‐follower
  (FVF) topology to enable designing the dominant pole at the output node for
  better power supply rejection (PSR) and less voltage variation during load
  transient. An enhanced super source follower (E‐SSF) is proposed to further
  reduce the output impedance of the buffer that drives the power transistor.
  The FVF‐based low dropout regulator (LDO) with E‐SSF achieves a worst‐case PSR
  of −18.9 dB across the full spectrum and a transient response time of 312 ps.
  The proposed LDO is designed in a 28 nm CMOS process and consumes 100 μA
  quiescent current with 1.0 V input and 0.8 V output voltages. In total, 120 pF
  on‐chip capacitors are used for filtering.
